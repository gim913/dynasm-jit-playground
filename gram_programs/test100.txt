this dummy program tries to break assumption     :
made in JIT generator, return value should be 6  :

 0: I(0, 0, 14)    jump to initialization

 1: I(1, 1, 6)
 2: I(1, 1, 6)
 3: I(1, 1, 6)
 4: I(1, 1, 6)     * * * * *
 5: Z(0)
 6: T(0,20)
 7: S(0)
 8: I(0,11, 1)
 9: I(0,12, 2)
10: I(0,13, 3)
11: I(0,14, 4)
12: I(0,15, 4)
13: I(0,0,100)  end of program
